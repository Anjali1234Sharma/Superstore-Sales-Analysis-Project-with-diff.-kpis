# Superstore-Sales-Analysis-Project-with-diff.-kpis
In this project, I undertook the task of creating files that indicate various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and designing a dashboard to visualize these metrics. The project involved different files to manage the data and present it in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.
To begin, I focused on developing the KPI files. These files served as repositories for the crucial metrics that were essential for monitoring and evaluating the performance of a specific process, system, or organization. Each KPI file was tailored to capture specific key metrics relevant to the project's objectives. For example, if the project aimed to assess sales performance.
After creating the KPI files, I proceeded to develop a comprehensive dashboard that visualized the data in an easily understandable format. The dashboard served as a centralized hub for monitoring and tracking the performance indicators across different dimensions.
